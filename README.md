# Asteroids-Project-Java
Project for my CMP 326: Java Programming class. Created a basic starter for an Asteroid game, where there are asteroid objects, space ships, stars, spaceship wraps around, and collision markers. Game doesn't fully function, in terms of keeping a correct score or life count. More work to be done.
